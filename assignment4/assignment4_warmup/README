This is a version of the assignment4 materials in which
Ast.java has been modified to include a very simple
(and highly incorrect!) version of the setReachability()
method. This is meant to help you get started with 
writing the real setReachability() method.

Note that the reachable flag on every statement is initialized
to true when the Stmt node is constructed.  The implementation
of setReachability() given here traverses the AST and sets
the flag to *false* on every statement.  The point of this is
just to illustrate what a simple tree traversal looks like 
in the AST context. You will still need to change the behavior
of this traversal (and perhaps add other traversal functions)
to get the desired behavior for your Ast1.java and Ast2.java.
